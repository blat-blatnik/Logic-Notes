# Logic-Notes

Personal notes for the Advanced Logic course I took. Based of off Graham Priest's [Introduction to Non-Classical Logic](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/an-introduction-to-nonclassical-logic/61AD69C1D1B88006588B26C37F3A788E) book.

It includes all of the tableau rules for first order logic (FOL), first degree entailment (FDE), Kleene logic (K3), ≈Åukasiewicz logic (L3), Logic of paradox (LP), R mingle (RM3), basic modal logic, tense logic, and first-order modal logic.

Hopefully somebody will find it helpful :)

## Other useful tools

Here is a list of other tools that I found that could be useful for checking homework solutions:
- [ProofTools](https://creativeandcritical.net/prooftools) can generate tableaux for Modal Logic, as well as constant-domain first-order modal logic (and more).
- [pytableaux](https://logic.dougowings.net/) can generate tableaux for FOL, FDE, K3, L3, L3 and RM3 (and more).
- [ExtensionCalculator](https://github.com/mbreemhaar/extensioncalculator) can generate process trees and extensions for default logic.
- [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator) can be used to quickly find counter-models for fuzzy logic exercises.
- [Truth Table Generator](https://github.com/blat-blatnik/Truth-Table-Generator) can generate truth tables for multi-valued logic.
